  "conclusion": "MemoryFlow has an 82% design match with the Figma prototyping kit, showing strong alignment with modern mobile design patterns. The app has a well-thought-out design system that rivals the Figma kit in many areas. Key improvements would be minor UI polish (rounded buttons, navigation labels) rather than major redesigns. The app's unique features for spaced repetition learning are well-designed and go beyond what the generic Figma kit offers."
